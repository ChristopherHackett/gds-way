When designing your services you may need to use a data store, for example to collect and store data, such as user details or web analytics data.
As well as supporting your service or app to run, the data may have other downstream uses, such as for analytics and reporting.
 It is prudent to consider building analytics into your service at the early stages.
For advice on this, reach out to GDS Data Services team using the #data-services Slack channel.

Read [the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology) for more information about choosing technology, development, integration, hosting, testing, security and maintenance.

## Documenting our data stores

The Government Digital Service (GDS) is digital by default, producing and collecting various data. Under the new Government Cyber Security Strategy and the associated Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF),
 there is a requirement relating to effectively managing our data stores (also referred to as data assets). The [Data Protection Act](https://www.gov.uk/data-protection) (UKâ€™s implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR))
  also requires us to understand the data we hold and how it is used.

Some of these data stores are captured in this GDS data management audit conducted in 2022 by GDS Data Services. The premise was to create a
[Github repository](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-data-management) of data sources with named owners,
in the hope that a federated approach would create accountable owners to maintain it. Each data source has an associated markdown document
which describes characteristics of the data organised, by GDS teams.

If you create a data source / data set during your time at GDS you are obliged to (under the CAF and Data Protection Act) document it in this [repository](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-data-management):

1. Fill in a copy of the [data management template](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-data-management/blob/main/templates/dmt_make_a_copy.md) for your dataset

2. Place the resulting document under the [organisation](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-data-management/tree/main/organisation) folder in this repository, under a new folder for the team that is responsible for the data. If a folder does not exist then create one.

This data is useful for your colleagues across GDS and also for GDS the Information Assurance team.
